Bulletin protocol notes

Bulletins are summarized by the server in a compact CSV text format,
thus:

  <name>,"<title>",<monitor>,<post>,<available>,<last-seen>,<read>

These are:
<name>		The Usenet compatible name of the topic,
		e.g., dartmouth.bulletins.unix

<title>		A human-readable descriptive title, spaces allowed.

<monitor>       Y or N, indicating whether the current user monitors this
		topic for updates.

<post>		Y or N, indicating whether the current user is allowed
		to post new articles to this topic.

<available>	A string of the form "\d+-\d+", giving the range of 
		article numbers currently available on the server.
		Generally, this is the smallest interval containing 
		all the available articles.

<last-seen>	The highest-numbered article ID the client has seen
		before.  Set by the client.

<read>		A description of what articles have been read.

The <read> information is a quoted string consisting of one or more
comma delimited integers or integer ranges, describing the article
numbers which have been read.  Appended to this sequence is a
semicolon and a signed integer value, whose purpose I have not yet
discerned.

Examples:
  2401;+0            # Article 2401 has been read, others unread.
  2399,2402;+0       # Articles 2399 and 2402 have been read, others unread.
  2399-2400,2402;+0  # Articles 2399, 2400, and 2402 read; others unread.

When the client downloads the list of all bulletin topics (using the
LSTB command), the <available>, <last-seen>, and <read> values might
not be correct.  The BULL command should be used to obtain up to date
values for any individual topic name.

The protocol is used by BlitzMail in the following manner:

1. Sign on, using UID#/PASE or KRB4.

2. Use NEWB to get a list of new bulletin arrivals.

3. Use GROUP/XHEAD to obtain the header information for the new
   arrivals.

4. When needed, use LSTB to obtain a complete topic listing for
   display in the "Bulletins" window.

To fetch an article, use ARTICLE, or HEAD/BODY.

To update the <last-seen> and <read> fields, use UPDT.

To subscribe to a bulletin, use ADDB; to unsubscribe, REMB.

To get the time of day from the server, use TOD.
